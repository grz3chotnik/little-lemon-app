                    Based in Chicago, Illinois, Little Lemon is a family owned Mediterranean restaurant*, focused on traditional recipes served with a modern twist. <br/>

                    The chefs draw inspiration from Italian, Greek, and Turkish culture and have a menu of 12-15 items that they rotate seasonally.<br/>

                    The restaurant has a rustic and relaxed atmosphere with moderate prices, making it a popular place for a meal any time of the day.<br/>

                    Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian, who moved to the United States to pursue their shared dream of owning a restaurant.<br/>

                    To craft the menu, Mario relies on family recipes and his experience as a chef in Italy.<br/>
